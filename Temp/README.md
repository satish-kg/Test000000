# F3-Contest1

## Project Overview 
### Tasks

- Make a simple form, execute the following event handlers.
- The form should contain 3 inputs - name, profession and age. All of these values are required.
- By default as soon as the user goes on the screen they see the default view with 0 added employees. A function is executed on click of this button which appends an object into an array.
- As they keep adding employees this array is mapped to show the data below Added Employees
- An error message is shown in red if the required fields are empty.
- A success message is shown in green if the fields are filled and the employee was added successfully.
- The structure of the array should be - [{id:1,name:"jack",profession:"developer",age:20}, {id:2,name:"john",profession:"admin",age:28}.... and so on] (The ID is given automatically)
- On clicking of the delete user button that specific object should be removed from the array and the div should disappear.
